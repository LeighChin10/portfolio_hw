    <p>Even though the season is over there's nothing wrong with looking at what our team should do moving forward starting with draft! This April the birds have a chance to turn the weaknesses of the team into strentgths. </p>

   <p>Popular Prospects to target in this years draft range from multiple positions. </p>

   <h2>First Round Pick Prospects</h2>
   <h5>Stick to the formula. The eagles have a history with addressing either the offensive line or defensive line in the first round. That's the reason we remain competitive because the best teams build from the inside out. Let's not change that this year. While the offensive line is setup well as long as Jason Kelce doesn't retire, the defensive line needs help. Brandon rush is more depth and Derek Barnett has been nothing special. With the receiver class being so deep I truly believe there's no reson to target a receiver too early when other positional needs the team has don't have the depth that the eagles have.</h5>

Absolut game wrecking player from the inside that has a quick first step and is massive at 6'6 310 pounds. Pairing him with Fletcher Cox seems almost unfair. </p></div>

<p>Defensive End AJ Espenesa out of Iowa is a prospect with versatility on the defensive line to be able to play both defensive tackle and defensive end. His comparison to me is Cam Heyward who is also versatile and wears the black and gold.</p></div>



   <h2>Second Round Prospects</h2>
   <h5>Addressing the cornerback woes. There are a good amount of corners in this draft with future star potential.</h5>

Corner with great instincts and checks pretty much every box you can check and them some. The only corner that Joe Burrow didnt torch this past year.</p> </body></div>


   <div><img src= "https://res-4.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,t_headline_primary/mlhu6wsra87e3zapzclg" width="1000" height="600"> <p>Cornerback Kristian Fulton from LSU is the next in line of great corners from 'DBU'. From day Fulton would be the best corner on the eagles walking through the door of the NovaComplex center. He's that good in both man and zone, if you don't believe the LSU hype please check all the defensive backs they have been producing. </p></div>



   <div><img src= "https://gofrogs.com/images/2019/7/22/Jeff_Gladney_2.jpg" wideth="1000" height="600"> <p>Jeff Gladney out of TCU is another corner that showcases some lockdown ability sticking with receivers stride for stride. Some off field issues in his history will likely slide him down the draft board and that should be perfect for the eagles to fill a major need.</p></div>

   <h2>Third Round Prospects</h2>
   <h5>Finally the receiver position gets addressed in the third round of this year's draft and with the Eagles owning multiple third round picks this year I think drafting a slot receiver and another corner is the move here because I fully believe the Eagles will sign Robby Anderson. All the receivers I list all have speed because the lack of speed has held back the offense for a few years now.</h5>

With the speed, size and abilty to potentially become a number one receiver. </p> </div>



  <div><img src= "https://www.buckeyextra.com/storyimage/OH/20190801/SPORTS/190809939/AR/0/AR-190809939.jpg" width="1000" height="600" > <p> KJ Hill has the speed, quickness, route running ability and hands to be a dynamic slot receiver at the next level.  </p> </div>




   <div><img src= "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K0CUMHWZ-rs/maxresdefault.jpg" width="1000" heigh="600"> <p>Darnay Holmes out of UCLA is the next slept on player who can potentially turn into the best player at his cornerback position in the class. If Holmes was 3 inches taller he would probably be a top 10 pick. Pairing Darnay Holmes and Cameron Dantzler together would not only solve the longtime cornerback issues but also create a devasting duo for the forseeable future.</p> </div>
